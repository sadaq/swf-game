Description:
In Flashbombs, you have to click like a maniac on a bomb to create a chain of explosions of the same colour as that bomb. To score bonus points and get a high score, try to get as many chain explosions as you can, before your time runs out! If you can get the timing right, youâ€™ll be getting multiple chain explosions every second! Hint: the size of the bombs impacts how long it takes for them to explode!
