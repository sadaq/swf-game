Description:
Port Pilot is a new and interesting action-puzzle game with a unique twist. Each boat will enter your waters with multiple, differently colored packages. By clicking and dragging on a particular boat, you can draw out the course of action and help the boats to unload all the packages into their corresponding colored ports. This never-before-seen challenge is both fun and difficult.

Instructions:
Use the mouse to click on a ship then drag a path to the coloured docks to unload.
