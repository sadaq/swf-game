Description:
War has begun! Take your soldier onto the battlefield and provide him the training necessary. In this first installment, you are pitted against 3 opponents using paintball guns to learn the art of warfare. Strafing behind crates provide excellent cover, but do not allow you to shoot over, so you have to be a quick thinker. A fun feature added is a time shift, allowing to to slow down time to get a better understanding of the field. Become a leader, not a follower in War Games!
