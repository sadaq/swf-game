Description:
In Monkey Cliff Diving, when a monkey pops up, click on the little chappy to make him dive. Time it right with the waves and wind and your monkey will live for another dive. Get the timing wrong and he will splatter himself on the rocks below! Be careful, as not all monkeys fall at the same speed! The quicker the monkey dives, the more points you get. Good Luck Monkey Diving Master!
