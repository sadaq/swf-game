Description:
Conquer the enemy castle in Ice Castle Blaster by firing catapult stones at them to destroy the whole castle. Use the mouse to aim, then fire the stones by holding the mouse button until you have charged enough power. Hitting a gate will awaken enemy knights who will charge at you to battle. Your own guards are skilled and can usually defeat one or two enemy knights. Make sure you have enough stones, guards and bounce by choosing the correct upgrades after each level.
