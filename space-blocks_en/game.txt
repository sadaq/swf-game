Description:
It's Tetris...in space! Move the dropping blocks into position to create lines. These lines will then be removed, and added to your total score. The game gives you a little help...the arrow keys can be used to rotate each shape to fit those "hard to reach" places. Plus, you get a preview of what's coming up. If the blocks reach the top of the grid...

Instructions:
· Rotate Pieces = Arrow Keys
· Drop Them = Space Bar
